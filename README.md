NOTES ON LEMMINIV1 FORK - John Watne, June 2023

This fork updates the application to use Open JDK 17 and drops separate
logic for runtimes prior to JDK 1.5. It includes extensive refactoring to modularize the
code into more cohesive Objects and methods. It implements several Checkstyle
fixes, compliant with the standard Sun checks.
